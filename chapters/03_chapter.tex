Within the research it is offered to construct the economic-mathematical model determining regression dependence of VC-backed firms' IPO Perfomance (initial VS current valuation) on various investment-related factors, such as raised capital, age, time to IPO, and others.

For this purpose we use the function determining linear dependence of efficiency of startups (growth rate of profitability of startups) on VC, an index of innovative development and indicators of quality of innovation infrastructure:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:OLS}
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_{1}X_{1}+...+\beta_{m}X_{m} + \varepsilon
\end{equation}

where:

$X_m$ are independent variables (VC, Age, years to IPO, Sector);

$\beta$ - parameters which are subject to definition; 

$\varepsilon$ â€“ random error;

$Y$ - dependent variable (growth rate of share price, \%);


%% CHANGE ... TO ACTIALS
$\beta_0$ - free member determining value of growth rate all else is equal to 0.

In practice, the estimated formula will be:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:OLS_hat}
    Growth = VC + Age + yearsIPO + C(Sector) + \varepsilon
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Growth = '\% Price change', how share value has changed since the IPO
    \item Age = 'Age', how many year ago the firm was founded
    \item yearsIPO = 'Years to IPO', how many years passed from founding the firm to going public
    \item Sector = 'Sector', B2B or B2C category
    \item VC = 'VC', raised venture capital, in \$ mill.
\end{itemize}
