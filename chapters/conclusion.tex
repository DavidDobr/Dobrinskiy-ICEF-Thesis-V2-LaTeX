While usefulness of VCs is questioned by causality problems and conflicts of interests which do not arise from traditional financing, the positive effects are still overwhelming.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item faster growth rates
    \item larger pre-IPO survival rates
    \item better IPO valuations
    \item higher post-IPO growth and revenue rates

    \item allows for faster growth due to availability of funds to pursue loss-generating expansionary strategy
\end{enumerate}
